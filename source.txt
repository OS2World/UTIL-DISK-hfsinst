HPFS386 INSTALLATION UTILITY - SOURCE CODE

  This program allows you to install the HPFS386 feature of OS/2 Warp Server
  for e-business without first having to install the IBM Network Products 
  Installer, or perform a manual CID installation.

  This is particularly useful on eComStation systems, where the IBM installer
  is not present on the system.

  You will need Watcom VX-REXX 2.1D to recompile this program.
